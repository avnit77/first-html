        <h3>Oceans are:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class=deadly>Made of water <strong>(ever heard of drowning?)</strong> </li>
            <li class=size>Too big for even Michael Phelps to swim across <strong> (and he has so many medals) </strong></li>
            <li class=size>So deep. You cannot touch the bottom while keeping your head above water in most parts of the ocean.</li>
        </ul>
